# Regex Console Application
## Description
This Qt-based console application analyzes text files for specific patterns in words. It allows users to apply different filters to count specific types of words within given text files.

The application supports the following commands and options:
- **count -a**: Count words longer than 4 characters that start with a capital letter.
- **count -b**: Count hyphenated words.
- **count -c**: Count words that start and end with the same character.
- **count -d**: Count words that do not start with a vowel.
- **count -help**: Display help information about the commands.

##Dependencies
